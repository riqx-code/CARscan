# Computer Vision Intern Submission

This is Nagisetti Rithihas , I have done Task-1 & Task-2.1.I have uploaded then in this repository.
 

# Task-1 : Damage Identification

**TASK_one** folder contains **json file**,**images** & **CODE** and **results**

I have uplaoded both .py main code , notebook demo.

In main code "task_1.py" , you need to upload the json files using path variables.
You can know where to do it , when you see the code.

Read Comments for better understanding.

**NOTE** : It is mentioned that "Data Visualization" folder contains the ***x-car.json*** and ***x.damage.json** but those files are in "Data Identification" folder i have used them.
In those folders side of the car data i.e. *** passenger side *** is not mentioned. so I did it manually by observing the images(as a part of ***bonus task***).

# Task-2 : Damage Classifer

I have contructed and Trained different models. All have been mentioned properly in **task_2_1.ipynb** file and **DEMO.ipynb** file.

Model , Weights and Architecture Drive links are mentioned in **task_2_1.ipynb** file and **DEMO.ipynb** file , way to implement them is also mentioned in the above files.
